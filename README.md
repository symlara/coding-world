# Coding-World

This site will be used as a portfolio for all of my work. A few of the boxes in the work section are not yet linked off to actual projects. Also I will be adding actual Contact information in the future, however, the GitHub and LinkedIn links are active.

This project has a mixture of:
* HTML
* CSS
* CSS GRID
* PSUEDO CLASSES
