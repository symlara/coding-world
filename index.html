            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>
                Hello there, and welcome to my site! My name is Aaliyah Symlar and I am an aspiring Developer from Tennessee. I graduated from Tennessee Tech University in 2017
                with a Bachelor of Science degree and I've been working in the Communications field for 3 years now.
                I'm currently working in the Communications Department for Vanderbilt University and my title is a Training and Support Specialist.
                I've been working there for 3 years now and I've always been fascinated with coding and all the details that go into being a Developer.
                I hope that once you're done looking over this site you will be pleased with the work I've accomplished so far!
